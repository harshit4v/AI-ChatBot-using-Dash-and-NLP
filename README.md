ðŸ¤– AI Chatbot Web App using Dash and NLP
A lightweight, interactive chatbot application built using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Dash by Plotly. This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for text classification and showcases a fully functional chatbot UI with a modern and aesthetic frontend.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

-Build a basic Q&A chatbot that can respond to user queries using a dataset of predefined questions and answers.
-Train an ML model to understand and classify user questions using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes.
-Create a beautiful, responsive web interface using Dash with animated gradients and modern design.
-Demonstrate the power of data storytelling and natural language understanding in a simple yet effective application.

Technologies & Concepts Used

-Python
-Dash (by Plotly) for web UI and interactivity
-Pandas for data handling
-NLTK for text preprocessing (tokenization)
-Scikit-learn:
-TfidfVectorizer for transforming text data
-MultinomialNB for classification
-Pipeline for combining steps
-Machine Learning: Text classification using supervised learning
-NLP: Tokenization, normalization of user inputs
-UI/UX: Custom CSS styles using Dashâ€™s layout components and linear gradients

Features

- Accepts user input and responds using an ML-trained model
- NLP preprocessing with nltk.word_tokenize and lowercasing
- Dynamic response generation using sklearn.pipeline
- Stylish UI with dark mode gradient headers, animated shadows, and responsive design
- Callback interaction using Dashâ€™s reactive component linking
